                                I was homeschooled in high school and I took some classes at Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee, OK 
                                concurrently with my homeschool work. I took several classes at OBU including Calculus 1 and 2 in 
                                the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 school years while I was a junior and senior in high school. I graduated 
                                in May 2019 and started at OBU the following fall. I was a Physics and Math double major but after a couple 
                                years I decided to switch to a Math major with a Computer Science minor. I am now in my senior year and 
                                will be graduating in May 2023. I plan to attend graduate school in the future to pursue a Masters or Ph.D. 
                                in Mathematics.

                                I was employed at Billy Boy BBQ in Shawnee, OK for a little over three years. I worked as a server 
                                where I served food and worked the cash register. I received a promotion to a managerial position 
                                where I supervised the employees, trained new hires (both as servers and managers), and was responsible 
                                for locking up the building at closing. I was in that position for about a year when I got an offer 
                                for an internship at AstroPanda Studios which is a software development studio and a Managed Cloud 
                                Services Provider. At the internship, I learned the programming language C#, Microsoft's Blazor 
                                framework for interactive client side web applications, and the software development process. After 
                                the internship was over I accepted a part-time job as an Apprentice Developer where I assist development
                                of multiple web applications using Blazor and MVC. I also have some experience tutoring mathematics both 
                                through Oklahoma Baptist University and freelance.

                                I have a lot of experience using C#. It is the primary language we use at AstroPanda to design our web 
                                applications. We also sometimes use JavaScript to easier interact with the browser. I also have plenty of
                                experience with HTML and CSS and some experience using JavaScript. I am additionally familiar with Python 
                                and have even created games in its Turtle drawing canvas (see the below section). At AstroPanda, we use 
                                a mixture of RESTful APIs and GraphQl to interact with SQL databases for data management thus I am 
                                familiar with using both of those for data management. I have used the Godot Game Engine and basic HTML 
                                and Javascript to develop games (see below section).

                                    I have been working on a side project, a small Blazor WASM application that I have called Games that will be the host to 
                                    games built in C# using Blazor. So far I have made a Blackjack game and a Dice Rolling simulator. The dice rolling uses 
                                    a REST API to handle the rolling of the dice and communicates the results to the Games web app using SignalR. I plan to 
                                    eventually add more games including solitaire.

                                development event, and myself and a few friends created a video game in 72 hours called Floppyfish using the Godot 
                                game engine. Go to our <a class="link" href="https://github.com/astro-panda/ldjam-51">GitHub for it here</a> and

                                I created a game using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is called Mole Patrol, it is my spin on the classic whack 
                                a mole. I used an Azure function and blob storage to create a leaderboard for the game. This is the link to the

                            In my spare time I like to build LEGO sets. Particularly Star Wars sets. I have a respectable collection and 
                            have plans to continue growing it. I also like to play video games. My two favorite types of games are first 
                            person puzzle games such as Portal or The Stanley Parable and open world rpgs (bonus points if there is a 
                            good sneaking mechanic).
